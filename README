Porkbun DDNS client (Dynamic Porkbun)

dpb is a lightweight, fast, and configurable Porkbun DDNS client. It can be used to periodically update A and AAAA records with your IP address. This is useful if you have a dynamic IP address, and your ISP won't give you a static one.

To use dpb, a configuration file is required in the same directory as the executable, named dpb.toml (can be configured). Run the executable with the -h flag to get help on how to use dpb.

You can download a pre-built binary from GitHub Releases, or you can build one yourself. No additional system dependencies are needed to build dpb, except the Rust toolchain, and Cargo.

Your IP address is acquired by pinging the Porkbun API. No third-party network services are accessed by dpb.
